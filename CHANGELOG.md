# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Hook path resolution** — `post.js` and `pre.js` resolve relative `file_path` values against the workspace root from the hook event, so guardrails still run when the hook process cwd differs from the agent session (common with Claude Code and Codex)
- **Windows zone matching in `pre.js`** — `editedPathForZoneMatch` uses `path.relative()` instead of a forward-slash `startsWith` check, so generated-cache and protected-path warnings match correctly on Windows
- **`pythia version` pending count** — semver gap and unresolved mixed migration state no longer double-count as two pending migrations; output shows a single pending item when either condition applies
- **Claude PostToolUse dedup** — `update` removes legacy non-managed hook groups that duplicate pythia runtime scripts without stripping the managed group's inner hooks

### Changed

- **Shared hook/restore helpers** — Codex/Cursor `hooks.json` merge, migration backup restore, and workflow checker iteration now use shared modules (`mergeHooksJson`, `restoreFromBackups`, `forEachWorkflowChecker`) used by CLI, health, and materialized runtime

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-19

### Features

- **`health` command** — `pythia health [target-dir]` checks workspace layout: manifest, protected seeds, runtime, installed surfaces, hook wiring, and paths registry invariants (default target: current directory)
- **Cursor surface (opt-in)** — `pythia init --surfaces cursor` (or add `cursor` to `--surfaces`) installs `.cursor/skills` and merges Cursor hook wiring alongside Claude/Codex defaults
- **`replace-section` migration op** — versioned migrations can replace or insert whole `##` sections (used by 0.3.3 paths upgrade for legacy VS Code–formatted and basename-only Workflow docs blocks)

### Changed

- **One-shot `init` bootstrap** — `pythia init` materializes runtime, applies pending migrations, and wires hooks in a single run; no mandatory follow-up `update` for first-time setup
- **Universal `AGENTS.md`** — generated from `assets/instructions.md` for all agent hosts (not Codex-branded); Codex hook wiring adds `MultiEdit` to the post-edit matcher set
- **Migration commit gate** — shared `commitMigrationVersion` runs only after verify passes; failed `replace-once` / `replace-section` steps no longer advance `migratedVersion`
- **Fresh workspace migration baseline** — new and adopted workspaces start at `migratedVersion: 0.0.0` so shipped migrations run on first bootstrap

### Fixed

- **`replace-once` false success** — migration fails when neither source nor replacement content exists, leaving manifest version unchanged
- **Cursor skills install** — `.cursor/skills` is included in active surfaces when requested (not skipped by the substitutions-only loop)
- **`uninstall` Cursor hooks** — removes pythia-managed entries from `.cursor/hooks.json`
- **Legacy hook detection** — install/uninstall/health recognize nested `{ hooks: [...] }` managed entries, not only top-level hook arrays
- **Checker sync on init** — warns when workflow doc types in `paths.md` reference checkers missing from materialized runtime

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-18

### Features

- **Path registry** — `.pythia/config/paths.md` defines artifact zones, workflow doc types, and which checkers run on each; hooks and validation read from this file instead of hardcoded lists
- **JS guardrail hooks** — `pre`, `post`, and `stop` hooks materialize into `.pythia/runtime/hooks/` on `update`; `post` routes checkers from the path registry (data-driven, no per-artifact hardcoding)
- **Workflow checkers in JavaScript** — bash validators replaced with `tools/checks/` modules: `doc-structure`, `links`, `inputs-fresh`, `role-boundary`, `plan-version-log`, `plan-numbering`, `cross-refs`, `plans-index`, and skill guards
- **`version` command** — `pythia-workspace version [target-dir]` shows installed framework version, surfaces, and migration status
- **`uninstall` command** — `pythia-workspace uninstall [target-dir]` removes managed agent surfaces and runtime while preserving `.pythia/workflows/`
- **Registry update check** — `update` warns when a newer `pythia-workspace` is available on npm

### Changed

- **Config layout** — workspace config moves to `.pythia/config/settings.md`; path registry lives at `.pythia/config/paths.md` (migration renames existing files on `update`)
- **Expanded workflow doc coverage** — path registry now includes `*.context.md`, `feat-*.md`, and `*.retro.md` with appropriate checkers; plan/review/implementation/audit docs get role-specific checker sets

### Migration

- **0.3.3 migration** — ensures `config/` layout, renames legacy `config.md` and `paths.md`, and upgrades Workflow docs section to hardened checker lists (skipped when already current)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Safe adopted-workspace update** — `update` now creates a gitignored pre-update snapshot at `.pythia/backups/pre-update-<timestamp>/.pythia/` before mutating an adopted `.pythia/` that has no committed local `.pythia/.git` history yet. This gives old workspaces a recovery point before seed/refresh/install/runtime work
- **Correct migration state advancement** — successful `update` now advances `migratedVersion` to the package `frameworkVersion` even when there are no versioned migration files. Adopted workspaces still plan from `0.0.0`, but they no longer remain permanently stale after a successful no-op migration pass
- **Pre-update state separation** — migration planning now uses the pre-update `migratedVersion` baseline instead of decisions based on a manifest that `update` just wrote during the same run

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **One-step `update` for old workspaces** — `update` now adopts a pre-existing `.pythia/` that was never provisioned by `init` (no `manifest.json` required) in a single run: it seeds any missing base files (`config.md`, `README.md`, `workflows/.gitkeep`) the same way `init` does, and stamps `migratedVersion: 0.0.0` so any actual pending migrations (when one exists for the artifact in question) still get applied on a later `update`. Base-file seeding is independent of the migration engine — it does not require or imply a versioned migration file for the current release
- **Migration zone relaxed to all of `.pythia/`** — the migration engine's auto ops were artificially restricted to `.pythia/workflows/`; they now operate anywhere inside `.pythia/`, with proper path-containment checks (rejects traversal escapes and absolute paths)
- **Skill pruning no longer deletes user-authored skills** — `update` tracks which skills it installed (`installedSkills` in manifest) and only prunes those that pythia previously installed and that have since been removed from the package; custom skills are never touched
- **`surfaces`/`gitStrategy` resolution** — `update` now reads these from the manifest when present, otherwise prompts (interactive) or applies non-interactive defaults, instead of silently guessing from disk state
- **Consistent `gitStrategy`/`surfaces` resolution across all CLI entry points** — the explicit `init` command, the explicit `update` command, and the bare auto-detect invocation (`pythia-workspace [target-dir]`) now resolve defaults through the same code path (explicit flag → manifest → interactive prompt → non-interactive default). Previously the auto-detect path bypassed both the prompt and the documented `pythia` default, silently writing `gitStrategy: "ignore"` and skipping the `git init .pythia/.git` side effect
- **Adoption-baseline detection now matches the relaxed migration zone** — a workspace is considered "adopted" (`migratedVersion: 0.0.0`, must run migrations) if it has *any* pre-existing content under `.pythia/`, not just `.pythia/workflows/`; this was inconsistent with the migration zone already covering all of `.pythia/`

### Breaking

- **`--target <dir>` removed everywhere** — CLI (`init`/`update`), all materialized runtime scripts (`apply`/`status`/`verify`/`commit`/`restore`), and the generated `.pythia/package.json` scripts. Target is now a positional argument on the CLI (default: current directory) and auto-derived from the script's own materialized path for runtime scripts
- **Default `gitStrategy` changed from `ignore` to `pythia`** — fresh `init`/`update` now initializes a local `.pythia/.git` by default unless overridden. This is repository ownership only (a one-time `git init`, no auto-commit) — not a pre-update checkpoint or rollback mechanism; see [docs/workspace-manager.md](docs/workspace-manager.md#gitstrategy)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-16

### Features
