# Pythia Concept

## System Overview

Pythia is a mediator platform that stores, manages, and develops a set of documents, rules, and contexts for effective interaction between humans and LLM. It serves simultaneously as memory, a communication channel, and a clearly structured foundation for collaboration between the two parties.

## Key Components

### 1. Rule Documents (Rules)

- Clearly define the behavior and boundaries of LLM operation
- Ensure stable, predictable AI results

### 2. Command Documents (Commands)

- Precise commands or instructions transmitted from human to LLM
- Describe what exactly needs to be done and how in specific tasks

### 3. Context Documents (Context)

- Store information about current interaction
- Contain all necessary information for task execution, accessible to both human and LLM

### 4. Workflow Documents (Workflow)

- Analytical and structured documents that capture the process of developing ideas, proposals, analysis, task creation, etc.
- Allow both human and LLM to have the same vision of the goal, status, and next steps in task execution

## System Role

- **Mediator**: Ensures clarity and understanding in interaction, eliminates inaccuracies and ambiguities
- **Structured Memory**: Stores and allows easy access to all important information used in work
- **Interaction Tool**: Documents are a living field of collaboration through which human and LLM can adjust tasks, clarify them, and conduct productive dialogue

## Key Participants

- **Human (user)**: Has tasks and wants to interact clearly and effortlessly with LLM
- **LLM (model)**: Potentially very powerful, but its response depends on how exactly the question is posed and what context it is given
- **Platform (Pythia)**: Acts as a mediator between human and LLM:
  - Ensures clarity and structure in interaction
  - Has transparent rules that form the context of the request
  - Manages information transmission and processing
  - Guarantees stable quality and predictability of results
  - Documents and automatically controls compliance with rules
  - Acts as a kind of oracle or guide that "predicts" or "calculates" exactly what to ask and how to get the best response
  - Integrates wisdom with modern technological approach (AI)

## Central Idea

Pythia is an "intermediate world" or "middle layer" that connects chaotic human requests with strictly logical but not always understandable artificial intelligence, harmonizing their interaction through rules and contexts.

## System Architecture

The system consists of two levels:

### 1. System Core

The core is developed as a separate repository. Its components:

- **Rules**: Basic interaction rules, response format requirements, quality control, etc.
- **Commands**: Commands that can be used as instructions or actions performed by LLM
- **Tools**: Automated scripts for working with documents, generating contexts, format conversion, validation
- **Guides**: Standards and recommendations for creating documents, workflows, and interacting with LLM
- **Methodology**: Set of approaches and principles that regulate the process of documentation generation and validation
- **Navigation**: Content navigation and organization tools (e.g., automatic indexing, tagging, search)

**Core features**:

- Independent and self-sufficient
- Regularly improved
- Can be updated from any project that uses it

### 2. Project-specific Implementation

Each project using the system integrates the core (via symlink or git submodule). Project-specific documents and contexts are created at the project level:

- **Context Documents**: Responsible for maintaining mutual understanding between user and LLM. They store project or task-specific information and can be updated dynamically.
- **Workflow Documents**: Store information about current task execution status, used for creating structured artifacts (analytics, proposals, reports).
- **Commands**: The project can define additional specific commands or extend existing ones for more precise work with LLM.

## Document Classification and Management

### Document Taxonomy

All documents in the Pythia system can be classified along two key dimensions:

1. **By Type** (functional purpose):

   - Rule Documents (Rules)
   - Command Documents (Commands)
   - Context Documents (Context)
   - Workflow Documents (Workflow)

2. **By Level of Belonging**:
   - **Core**: Documents that are part of the system's main repository and form its core. They are stable, universal, and can be used in any project
   - **Working**: Documents generated in the context of a specific project for solving practical tasks. They are human-specific, as the user decides what information goes into the document and in what form. These documents can integrate with other systems (Jira, Confluence) for creating proposals, decisions, context
   - **Project**: Documentation generated based on context documents and becomes part of the project itself (stored in the project repository). These documents form the project's institutional memory

### Document Lifecycle

Documents in the Pythia system go through the following stages:

1. **Creation**: Through defined commands or templates
2. **Usage**: Integration with other documents and application in interaction
3. **Update**: Content adjustment based on new requirements or knowledge
4. **Archiving**: Preservation of outdated versions for history and analysis

### Interaction Between Document Types

Interaction between different document types is built on these principles:

1. **Extension Instead of Modification**: Working and project documents extend the functionality of core ones but don't modify them directly
2. **Structure Inheritance**: All documents follow structural standards defined in core documents
3. **Context Enrichment**: Working documents add specific context for solving current tasks
4. **Level Transitions**: Successful practices from working documents can be formalized in project documents and later integrated into core ones

### Synchronization and Update Mechanisms

To maintain document relevance, the following are applied:

1. **Compliance Audit**: Regular document checking for standards compliance
2. **Automatic Validation**: Scripts for detecting deviations from standards
3. **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Procedures for safely updating core documents and integrating them with working and project ones

## Document Transformation Process

An important aspect of the Pythia system is the process of knowledge transformation between document levels:

1. **From Core to Working**: Application of universal principles and templates to specific work tasks
2. **From Working to Project**: Extraction of valuable practices and knowledge from working documents and their formalization into project documentation
3. **From Project to Core**: Generalization of successful project practices to the level of universal principles

This cyclic transformation ensures continuous system improvement while maintaining stability of core components.

## Physical Repository Structure

### Core Structure

The Pythia system core is organized in a separate repository with the following structure:

```
pythia-core/
├── rules/               # Basic rules for LLM interaction
├── commands/            # Instructions and commands for working with documents
├── methodology/         # Methodological approaches and principles
├── templates/          # Templates for document creation
├── tools/              # Tools for document automation
├── navigation/         # Tools for navigation between documents
├── CONCEPT.md          # Conceptual system description
└── README.md           # General information and instructions
```

### Project Structure with Integrated Core

When Pythia core is integrated into a specific project, the structure looks like this:

```

├── src/                     # Project source code
└── ... (other project directories)
```

### Document Classification by Location

Documents in the Pythia system are distributed across three levels, each with its physical location:

1. **Core Documents**:

   - Location: Pythia core in `/.pythia/core` directory
   - Include: rules, commands, methodology, templates, navigation tools
   - Features: universal, stable, common across all projects
   - Examples: formatting rules, document creation commands, methodological approaches

2. **Working Documents**:

   - Location: `/.pythia/workflows/` directory in project documentation
   - Include: tasks, proposals, decisions, ideas and their research
   - Features: project-specific, dynamic, reflect current process
   - Examples: task description, change proposal, decision record

3. **Project Documents**:
   - Location: `/.pythia/contexts/`, `/.pythia/architecture/`, `/.pythia/guides/` directories in project documentation
   - Include: contexts, architectural documentation, instructions
   - Features: formalized, structured, store important project information
   - Examples: project overview, technical context, technology choice decision

## Component Integration

For effective system operation, integration of all components into a unified "ecosystem" approach is important:

1. **Cross-references Between Documents**: System of interconnections allowing navigation between related documents
2. **Automatic Context Aggregation**: Mechanisms for collecting relevant information from different documents
3. **Contextual Navigation**: Ability to find related documents by task context
4. **Tagging and Metadata**: Structured information for classification and search
