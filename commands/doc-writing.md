# Command: Write Human Documentation

<command_purpose>
This command provides guidelines for LLMs to write documentation that reads naturally and avoids common AI writing patterns. Use this when creating or editing any documentation to ensure it sounds human-written and professional.
</command_purpose>

## Purpose

This command helps LLMs produce high-quality, human-like documentation by identifying and avoiding common AI writing patterns. Based on extensive research of AI writing characteristics, this guide provides concrete rules and examples to make your documentation clear, concise, and natural.

## Quick Reference

<quick_ref>

**Goal**: Write documentation that is indistinguishable from quality human writing

**Key Principle**: Be direct, specific, and avoid flowery language

**Red Flags**:
- Overuse of certain phrases (delve, crucial, robust, leverage)
- Excessive formatting (bold text, em-dashes)
- Promotional tone (cutting-edge, revolutionary)

**Self-Check**: Review your text against the checklist before finalizing

</quick_ref>

## Prerequisites

Before using this command:

1. [ ] Understand the target audience and their expertise level
2. [ ] Know the specific purpose of the documentation
3. [ ] Have access to source material or requirements
4. [ ] Be familiar with the project's existing documentation style

## Self-Check Checklist

<self_check>
Before finalizing any documentation, verify:

**Language Quality**
- [ ] No overuse of "delve," "crucial," "vital," "robust," "enhance," "leverage"
- [ ] No promotional language ("cutting-edge," "revolutionary," "game-changing")
- [ ] No vague importance claims ("plays a pivotal role," "underscores the significance")
- [ ] No collaborative phrases ("Let's explore," "we can see")
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive voice

**Formatting**
- [ ] No excessive use of em-dashes (‚Äî) or bold text
- [ ] No emoji unless explicitly required by the project style
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy maintained

**Content Structure**
- [ ] Sections don't end with "Challenges and Future Prospects"
- [ ] No "Rule of Three" patterns (three parallel items everywhere)
- [ ] Specific facts over general statements
- [ ] No placeholder text or TODOs

</self_check>

| "crucial" | "important," "necessary," "required" | Required for authentication |
| "vital" | "essential," "needed," "important" | Essential configuration step |
| "robust" | "reliable," "stable," specific metrics | Handles 10K requests/second |
| "enhance" | "improve," specify improvement | Improves response time by 40% |
| "leverage" | "use," "apply" | Use the caching system |
| "facilitate" | "enable," "allow," "make easier" | Enables faster processing |

## Practical Examples

<practical_examples>

### Example 1: API Documentation

<comparison>
<bad label="AI-like">
## Overview

This comprehensive API empowers developers to seamlessly integrate our
cutting-edge authentication system into their applications. Leveraging
industry-standard protocols, it provides a robust and secure solution
that enhances user experience while maintaining the highest levels of
data protection.

### Key Features

- **Robust Security**: Utilizing advanced encryption
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy to implement
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides
</bad>

<good label="Human-like">
## Authentication API

This API handles user authentication using OAuth 2.0. It returns JWT
tokens valid for 24 hours.

### Endpoints

- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Invalidate token

### Security

- Tokens use RS256 signing
- All endpoints require HTTPS
- Rate limit: 100 requests per hour per IP
</good>

<analysis>
**What makes it better:**
- Specific protocol (OAuth 2.0) instead of "industry-standard"
- Concrete token validity (24 hours) instead of vague claims
- Real endpoints with HTTP methods
- Measurable security details (RS256, rate limits)
- No promotional language
</analysis>
</comparison>

### Example 2: Feature Description

<comparison>
<bad label="AI-like">
## Export Feature

The export functionality represents a significant enhancement to the user
experience, enabling stakeholders to efficiently extract data in multiple
formats. This feature not only supports CSV and JSON but also provides
robust filtering capabilities, thus empowering users to customize their
exports according to their specific needs.
</bad>

<good label="Human-like">
## Export Data

Users can export data in CSV or JSON format.

To export:

1. Click "Export" in the top-right menu
2. Select format (CSV or JSON)
3. Choose columns to include (optional)
4. Click "Download"

Exports are limited to 10,000 rows. For larger datasets, use the API.
</good>

<analysis>
**What makes it better:**
- Direct, actionable steps instead of abstract descriptions
- Specific limit (10,000 rows) instead of vague capabilities
- Simple list format for procedures
- Clear alternative for edge case (API for large datasets)
- No "empowerment" or promotional language

## Common Issues and Solutions

<troubleshooting>

| Issue | Solution | Example Fix |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Text sounds too formal or flowery | Remove adjectives. Use simple, direct sentences | "Utilize robust methodologies" ‚Üí "Use proven methods" |
| Overuse of certain words | Run word frequency check. Vary naturally | Search for "crucial", "delve", "leverage" - replace each |
| Too much emphasis (bold, italics) | Use formatting only for UI elements, code, warnings | Remove **bold** from regular text, keep for `code` |
| Vague statements | Add specific numbers, dates, versions, sources | "Recently" ‚Üí "March 2024", "Many users" ‚Üí "73%" |
| Promotional tone | Remove marketing language. State facts neutrally | "Revolutionary platform" ‚Üí "Released in 2023" |
| Sections too long | Break into smaller sections. Use lists | Convert paragraphs to numbered steps or bullet points |
| Overuse of passive voice | Rewrite in active voice | "is processed by" ‚Üí "processes" |

</troubleshooting>

**Collaborative phrases:**
- "Let's," "we can see," "it's important to note"
</check>

### 2. Pattern Check

<check type="formatting">
- **Em-dashes**: Count (‚Äî). Should be < 2 per 100 words
- **Bold text**: Should be < 5% of total text
- **List variety**: Check for three-item lists in succession. Vary list lengths
- **Heading hierarchy**: Verify proper H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 structure
</check>

### 3. Structure Review

<check type="structure">
- [ ] No sections titled "Challenges and Future Prospects"
- [ ] No meta-commentary ("This section covered...")
- [ ] No promotional language in technical descriptions
- [ ] No placeholder text ([TODO], [TBD])
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
</check>

### 4. Specificity Test

<check type="specificity">
For each claim, verify:

- ‚úÖ Is there a specific number, date, or version?
- ‚úÖ Is there a named source?
- ‚úÖ Are examples concrete and realistic?
- ‚ùå If not, can you add specifics or remove the claim?

**Example transformations:**
- "Recently released" ‚Üí "Released March 2024"
- "Many users" ‚Üí "73% of surveyed users"
- "Fast performance" ‚Üí "Processes 10K requests/second"
</check>

## Summary

<command_summary>

**Core Principle**: Write documentation that is indistinguishable from quality human writing by being direct, specific, and factual.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Avoid AI-telltale phrases** (delve, crucial, leverage, robust)
2. **Use concrete facts** with numbers, dates, and sources
3. **Keep formatting minimal** (limited bold, no excessive em-dashes)
4. **Write naturally** (no collaborative phrases, no promotional tone)
5. **Validate systematically** using the 4-step validation process

**Before finalizing, ask yourself**:
- Would a human expert write this way?
- Are all claims backed by specific facts?
- Have I removed all AI writing patterns?
