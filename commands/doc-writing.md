- [ ] No vague importance claims ("plays a pivotal role," "underscores the significance")
- [ ] Sections don't end with "Challenges and Future Prospects"
- [ ] No "Rule of Three" patterns (three parallel items everywhere)
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive voice
- [ ] Specific facts over general statements
- [ ] No collaborative phrases ("Let's explore," "we can see")
- [ ] No emoji unless explicitly required by the project style

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                             | Solution                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text sounds too formal or flowery | Remove adjectives. Use simple, direct sentences.                      |
| Overuse of certain words          | Run a word frequency check. Vary vocabulary naturally.                |
| Too much emphasis (bold, italics) | Use formatting only for UI elements, code, or crucial warnings.       |
| Vague statements                  | Add specific numbers, dates, versions, or sources.                    |
| Promotional tone                  | Remove all marketing language. State facts neutrally.                 |
| Sections too long                 | Break into smaller sections. Use lists for multiple items.            |
| Overuse of passive voice          | Rewrite in active voice: "The system processes" not "is processed by" |

---

## Validation Process

After writing documentation, run these checks:

### 1. Phrase Detection

Search for these terms and review each usage:

- "delve," "crucial," "vital," "robust," "leverage," "enhance," "facilitate"
- "seamless," "innovative," "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art"
- "Let's," "we can see," "it's important to note"

### 2. Pattern Check

- Count em-dashes (‚Äî). Should be < 2 per 100 words.
- Count bold text uses. Should be < 5% of text.
- Check for three-item lists in succession. Vary list lengths.

### 3. Structure Review

- No sections titled "Challenges and Future Prospects"
- No meta-commentary ("This section covered...")
- No promotional language in technical descriptions

### 4. Specificity Test

For each claim:

- Is there a specific number, date, or version?
- Is there a named source?
- If not, can you add one or should the claim be removed?
