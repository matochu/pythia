## Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

- The PR Title and Summary must always clearly and unambiguously state the primary purpose and intent of the PR, regardless of the type of change (feature, fix, refactor, workflow, documentation, etc.).
- Avoid generic or vague titles/summaries. The main change or goal should be immediately clear to reviewers.
- In the Features/Changes section, describe the main change in detail, including its purpose, how it works, and its impact.
- If the PR contains multiple unrelated changes, group them by logical category and ensure each groupâ€™s purpose is clear.

### Summary Section

- Explain what problem this PR solves
- Why the change is necessary
- Overall approach taken
- Expected outcomes or benefits
- Keep brief (2-5 sentences)

### Changes Section

For each change, include:

- What was changed
- How it works now
- Benefits of the change

### Implementation Section

Include:

- Architectural decisions
- Design patterns used
- Dependencies added or modified
- Configuration changes
- Code snippets for complex changes when helpful

### Testing Section

Describe:

- How changes were tested
- Test types added or modified
- Edge cases considered
- Performance impacts
- Browser/device compatibility

## Output Format

Always provide the PR description:

1. In English, regardless of request language
2. As a properly formatted Markdown code block:

````
```markdown

```
````

## Examples

> These are examples only. Always tailor the Title and Summary to the actual main purpose of your PR.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Too Brief Descriptions**: Use the structured format with adequate detail in each section.
2. **Missing Context**: Always include context in the Summary section.
3. **Unorganized Changes**: Categorize changes into Features, Bug Fixes, Performance, etc.
4. **No Testing Information**: Always describe testing methods and results.
5. **Missing Visual Evidence**: Include screenshots or videos for UI changes.
6. **Non-English Description**: Always write in English for consistency.
7. **Raw Format Missing**: Provide the description in a markdown code block for easy copying.
