# Command: Spark-Improve Instruction

> **IMPORTANT**: This command applies GitHub Spark's systematic approach to instruction improvement, treating the instruction as a "missing manual" that needs comprehensive documentation, iterative refinement, and built-in safety mechanisms. It transforms instructions into production-ready, well-documented, and thoroughly tested artifacts.

## Purpose

This command applies the systematic quality improvement principles derived from GitHub Spark's approach to instruction development. It treats each instruction as a comprehensive system that requires detailed documentation, iterative refinement, built-in safety mechanisms, and thorough testing. The command transforms basic instructions into production-ready, well-structured, and maintainable documentation artifacts that follow GitHub Spark's philosophy of treating system prompts as the "missing manual" for sophisticated tool usage.

1. [ ] Identified the target instruction or command to improve
2. [ ] Obtained the current date for proper document timestamping
3. [ ] Read and understood the target instruction completely
