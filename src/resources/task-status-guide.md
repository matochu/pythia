# Task Status Management Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive information about task status management in Pythia projects, including status definitions, transitions, and best practices.

## Status Definitions

### Not Started

**Description**: Task has been created but work has not yet begun
**Characteristics**:

- Task file exists with initial metadata
- No implementation work completed
- Dependencies may be identified but not resolved
- Context documents may be referenced but not reviewed

**When to Use**:

- Newly created tasks
- Tasks waiting for dependencies
- Tasks on hold pending decisions
- Tasks scheduled for future work

**Next Actions**:

- Review task requirements
- Identify and resolve dependencies
- Gather necessary context documents
- Plan implementation approach

### In Progress

**Description**: Active development work is underway
**Characteristics**:

- Implementation work has begun
- Progress is being made on objectives
- Dependencies are being resolved
- Context documents are being utilized

**When to Use**:

- Development work is actively happening
- Regular progress is being made
- Team members are working on the task
- Implementation phases are being completed

**Next Actions**:

- Continue implementation work
- Update progress regularly
- Monitor for blockers
- Prepare for review when ready

### Under Review

**Description**: Task is complete and awaiting review or approval
**Characteristics**:

- Implementation work is finished
- Code/documentation is ready for review
- Quality control checks are in progress
- Approval is pending

**When to Use**:

- Implementation is complete
- Code review is in progress
- Documentation review is pending
- Final approval is required

**Next Actions**:

- Complete review process
- Address feedback
- Make necessary corrections
- Move to completed when approved

### Blocked

**Description**: Task cannot proceed due to external dependencies or issues
**Characteristics**:

- Work is stopped due to external factors
- Dependencies are not available
- External issues prevent progress
- Resolution is outside team control

**When to Use**:

- External dependencies are unavailable
- Third-party issues prevent progress
- Resource constraints block work
- Technical issues require external resolution

**Next Actions**:

- Identify blocking factors
- Escalate to appropriate parties
- Find alternative approaches
- Monitor for resolution

### Completed

**Description**: Task is fully finished and validated
**Characteristics**:

- All objectives achieved
- Quality control passed
- Documentation updated
- Stakeholder approval received

**When to Use**:

- All work is finished
- Quality standards met
- Documentation complete
- Stakeholder approval received

**Next Actions**:

- Archive task
- Update project status
- Celebrate completion
- Apply lessons learned

## Status Transitions

### Normal Progression

```
not-started → in-progress → under-review → completed
```

### Blocked Transitions

```
not-started → blocked
in-progress → blocked
under-review → blocked
```

### Recovery from Blocked

```
blocked → not-started (if reset needed)
blocked → in-progress (if work can resume)
blocked → under-review (if work was completed while blocked)
```

### Regression (Rare)

```
completed → under-review (if issues found)
under-review → in-progress (if major changes needed)
in-progress → not-started (if complete restart needed)
```

## Status Update Rules

### Forward Progression

- **Allowed**: Moving forward in normal progression
- **Required**: Justification for any regression
- **Timing**: Update status when work phase changes

### Blocked Status

- **When to Set**: External factors prevent progress
- **Documentation**: Must include reason and expected resolution
- **Monitoring**: Regular check for resolution

### Completed Status

- **Requirements**: All objectives met and validated
- **Validation**: Quality control and stakeholder approval
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation summary

## Status Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring

- Check for status changes
- Identify blocked tasks
- Monitor progress on active tasks
- Update status as needed

### Weekly Review

- Review all task statuses
- Identify patterns and trends
- Address blocked tasks
- Plan upcoming work

### Monthly Analysis

- Analyze status distribution
- Identify bottlenecks
- Review status transition patterns
- Improve status management process

## Status Reporting

### Individual Task Status

- Current status
- Time in current status
- Next planned action
- Blocking factors (if any)

### Project Status Summary

- Total tasks by status
- Status distribution percentages
- Average time in each status
- Blocked task analysis

### Status Trends

- Status transition patterns
- Time spent in each status
- Common blocking factors
- Completion rate trends

## Best Practices

### Status Updates

- **Frequency**: Update status when work phase changes
- **Accuracy**: Ensure status reflects actual work state
- **Documentation**: Include reason for status changes
- **Consistency**: Use standard status values

### Status Monitoring

- **Regular**: Check status regularly
- **Proactive**: Identify potential issues early
- **Responsive**: Address blocked tasks quickly
- **Analytical**: Learn from status patterns

### Status Communication

- **Clear**: Use standard status terminology
- **Timely**: Communicate status changes promptly
- **Complete**: Include context and reasoning
- **Consistent**: Follow established communication patterns

## Common Issues

### Stale Status

- **Problem**: Status not updated regularly
- **Solution**: Implement regular status review process

### Incorrect Status

- **Problem**: Status doesn't reflect actual work state
- **Solution**: Improve status update discipline

### Blocked Task Management

- **Problem**: Blocked tasks not addressed
- **Solution**: Implement blocked task escalation process

### Status Inconsistency

- **Problem**: Different teams use different status values
- **Solution**: Standardize status definitions and usage

## Tools and Automation

### Status Tracking Tools

- Task management systems
- Project tracking software
- Custom status dashboards
- Automated status reports

### Status Validation

- Automated status checks
- Status transition validation
- Required field validation
- Status consistency checks

### Status Reporting

- Automated status reports
- Status trend analysis
- Blocked task alerts
- Completion rate tracking
