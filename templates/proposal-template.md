## Current State

Describe the current implementation/approach with focus on the problems that need to be solved. This section should:

- Clearly outline existing limitations or issues
- Include specific examples of problematic areas
- Reference metrics or user feedback where applicable
- Cite existing analysis documents for deeper context

## Proposed Solution

Detail the proposed changes, explaining how they address the problems identified in the Current State. This section should include:

- High-level architecture overview
- Key components and their interactions
- Code examples where appropriate
- Technical specifications and constraints
- Integration points with existing systems

### Solution Components

#### Component 1

Description of the first component of the solution.

```typescript
// Example code for component 1
const exampleComponentOne = () => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

#### Component 2

Description of the second component of the solution.

```typescript
// Example code for component 2
const exampleComponentTwo = () => {
  // Implementation details
};
```
