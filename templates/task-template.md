### Checkbox Markers (Lightweight Conventions)

- `[LLM]` is the default actor and can be omitted. Any unchecked box without other markers is assumed to be performable by LLM.
- Use `- [ ] ... [H]` for steps that only a human should confirm (LLM never checks these).
- LLM can prepare evidence/notes for each `[H]` item (commands run, links, outcomes) but leaves the box unchecked.
- Example: `- [ ] Create branch 'feature/xyz' and push initial commit [H]`.

### How to Work with This Task

1. **Before Starting**:

   - [ ] Review all Context Documents and related analysis
   - [ ] Check Dependencies section for blockers
   - [ ] Set up Change Tracking (see below)

2. **During Implementation**:

   - [ ] Update Progress Tracking after each phase
   - [ ] Document key decisions in context documents
   - [ ] Add changed files to File Changes section
   - [ ] Run AI Solution Analysis for major changes (use @analyze-ai-solutions.md)
   - [ ] Update Context sections when new insights emerge

3. **Quality Control Phase** (Required before completion):

   - [ ] Add/Update tests for all new/changed code (unit/integration as appropriate)
   - [ ] Run coverage and capture summary (target â‰¥ 85% or project-specific)
   - [ ] Run AI Solution Analysis (use @analyze-ai-solutions.md command)
   - [ ] Run Self-Review Process (see section below)
   - [ ] Validate against Success Criteria
   - [ ] Check Quality Standards compliance
   - [ ] Update context documents with final insights
   - [ ] TDD Integration: Ensure test-driven development workflow is followed

4. **Task Completion**:
   - [ ] Complete Implementation Summary
   - [ ] Archive relevant sessions to context documents

   - [ ] Mark task as Completed

### Change Tracking Setup

```bash
# Set up change tracking for this task
TASK_ID="task-YYYY-MM-descriptive-name"
echo "# Changed Files for $TASK_ID" > .task-changes.md
echo "**Start Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> .task-changes.md
echo "" >> .task-changes.md

# Track changes during work (run after each significant change)
git status --porcelain >> .task-changes.md
```

### Context Document Integration
