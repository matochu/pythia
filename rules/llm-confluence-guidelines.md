# Confluence Guidelines for LLM

This document outlines best practices, recommendations, and requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs) when working with Confluence in the context of the project.

## General Guidelines

1. **Space Awareness**:

   - Always be aware of the space you're working in (e.g., DT1 for Development Team).
   - Understand the existing structure and hierarchy of pages before creating new ones.
   - Maintain consistency with the existing information architecture.
   - For detailed information about the current Confluence structure, refer to [Confluence Structure](../architecture/confluence-structure.md).

2. **Metadata Handling**:

   - Do NOT add "Created" or "Last Updated" dates at the bottom of pages - Confluence automatically tracks this information.
   - Include an attribution note about the LLM model used to create/edit the page, e.g., "Content initially generated by [llm name] [llm version]".
   - Use Confluence's native metadata capabilities where available.

3. **Content Structure**:

   - Use Confluence's hierarchical structure (parent/child pages) appropriately.
   - Follow existing patterns for page organization.
   - Create meaningful page titles that clearly describe the content.

4. **Formatting**:

   - Use Markdown formatting when preparing content.
   - Use headings (H1, H2, H3) for proper content hierarchy.
   - Use lists, tables, and other formatting elements appropriately.
   - Include useful hyperlinks to related pages or external resources.

5. **Page Creation Process**:
   - Plan the page structure before creation.
   - Get approval for new page creation in important spaces.
   - Follow the established naming conventions for pages.
   - Ensure proper parent-child relationships.

## DT1 Space Guidelines

Based on analysis of the DT1 (Development Team) space, follow these specific guidelines:

1. **Structure Awareness**:

   - The DT1 space contains technical documentation and team information.
   - Main page "Development Team" serves as a hub with team contact information.
   - Primary content includes workflow documentation, technical specifications, and environment descriptions.
   - See the [current structure documentation](../architecture/confluence-structure.md#current-structure-overview) for a detailed breakdown.

2. **Integration**:

   - Integrate new knowledge sharing initiatives with existing content.
   - Link to relevant existing pages like "Development Work Flow".
   - Maintain continuity with established documentation practices.

3. **Content Types**:
   - Technical specifications should be detailed and precise.
   - Workflow documentation should include clear step-by-step instructions.
   - Team information should be factual and professional.

## Knowledge Sharing Initiative Guidelines

When working on the knowledge sharing initiative in Confluence:

1. **Page Hierarchy**:

   - Maintain the planned structure with "Tools & Practices Hub" as the main entry point.
   - Create proper parent-child relationships between pages.
   - Use consistent naming patterns for similar types of pages.

2. **Templates**:

   - Apply consistent templates for similar types of pages.
   - Personal tools & practices pages should follow the established template.
   - Maintain consistency in formatting and structure.

3. **Content Creation**:

   - Focus on clarity and useful information.
   - Include practical examples where appropriate.
   - Avoid overly theoretical or abstract content without practical application.
   - Make content scannable with clear headings and concise sections.

4. **Contributors Information**:
   - When creating personal knowledge pages, clearly indicate whose knowledge is being shared.
   - Use precise attributions for shared knowledge and tools.

## Technical Best Practices

1. **API Interactions**:

   - Understand the limitations of the Confluence API.
   - Handle errors gracefully when creating or editing pages.
   - Verify successful page creation/modification.

2. **Content Limitations**:

   - Be aware of Confluence's limitations on page content size.
   - Break very large content into multiple linked pages.
   - Optimize images and attachments for Confluence.

3. **Search Optimization**:
   - Use clear, descriptive titles.
   - Include relevant keywords in headings and content.
   - Create proper linking between related pages.

## Example Page Creation

When creating a new page, follow this pattern:

```markdown
# Page Title

## About This Page

[Clear description of the page purpose]

## Main Content Sections

[Organized with clear H2 and H3 headings]

## Related Resources

[Links to related pages or external resources]

---

<div style="text-align: right;">
<sub><em>Content initially generated by [llm name] [llm version]</em></sub>
</div>
```
