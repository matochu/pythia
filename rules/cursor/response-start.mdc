# Response Start Rules

> **IMPORTANT**: Respond in the same language as the user's question (Ukrainian, English, etc.)

## At the Beginning of Every Response

### 1. Current Task Focus

**ALWAYS** start your response by focusing ONLY on the current user request and **Respond in the same language as the user's question**:

1. **Repeat the current user's task/request** in your own words
2. **Explain how you understand the CURRENT task** - what needs to be done, what the expected outcome is
3. **If there is an active work item (task/idea/exploration/proposal), explicitly reference it in "My Understanding" and plan to record progress there**
4. **Do NOT reference or repeat previous tasks** from the conversation (unless it's the active work item)
5. **Do NOT wait for confirmation** - proceed with the current task after clarifying your understanding
6. **Focus on the immediate request** - avoid going back to unrelated previous work
7. **Respond in the same language as the user's question** (Ukrainian, English, etc.)

### 2. Example Format

```
## Task Understanding

**User Request:** [exact current user request]

**My Understanding:**
- What needs to be done: [description of current task]
- Expected outcome: [description of current task outcome]
- Key requirements: [list for current task]
- Potential challenges: [list for current task]
- Impact analysis: [what will be affected by this change]
- Context needed: [what additional context should be considered]
- Current work item: [link/path to active task/idea/exploration/proposal]
- Progress updates: [state that progress will be marked in that document]

**Proceeding with implementation...**
```

### 3. Anti-Looping Rules

**NEVER:**

- Repeat previous tasks that are not related to the current request
- Go back to work from earlier in the conversation unless explicitly asked
- Create todo lists for tasks that are already completed
- Reference previous task understanding unless directly relevant

**ALWAYS:**

- Focus on the immediate user request
- If the request is about fixing something, focus on that specific fix
- If the request is about updating something, focus on that specific update
- Keep context minimal and relevant to current task

### 4. Todo List Creation (Only When Requested)

When creating todo lists for NEW tasks:

1. **Use chat API todo functionality** whenever possible
2. **Break down complex tasks** into actionable items
3. **Include task status tracking** (pending, in progress, completed)
4. **Add context and dependencies** between tasks

### 5. Task Status Updates

- Update todo items as you complete them
- Add notes about blockers or dependencies
- Mark tasks as completed with brief summary
- If a planning document exists, update its progress/status and checkboxes in that document

## Communication Principles

### Active Work Item Sync

- If there is an active planning document (task/idea/exploration/proposal), reference it in "My Understanding" and record progress in that document (status, checkboxes, notes).
- Keep the response concise here; details and progress belong in the planning document.

### Always

- Be clear and concise
- Use technical language appropriately
- Provide context for decisions
- Show your work and reasoning
- Focus on the current request

### Never

- Wait for confirmation before starting
- Assume user knowledge of technical details
- Skip important steps without explanation
- Leave tasks incomplete without explanation
- Loop back to previous unrelated tasks

## LLM Self-Check

**Before responding, check:**

- [ ] **KISS**: Is this the simplest solution?
- [ ] **DRY**: Am I repeating myself?
- [ ] **YAGNI**: Am I adding features not requested?
- [ ] **FOCUS**: Does this answer the exact question?
- [ ] **CONCISE**: Can I say this in fewer words?
- [ ] **WORK ITEM SYNC**: Did I reference the active planning document and update progress there?

**If yes to any above - simplify immediately.**

## Integration with Other Rules

This response start approach should be integrated with:

- Development rules for technical tasks
- Documentation rules for documentation tasks
- Project-specific workflows and standards
